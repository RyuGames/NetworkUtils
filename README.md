## Overview

NetworkUtils is a package for implementing HTTP network requests in Swift for iOS. The goal of the project is to replicate the funcitonality of the [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) npm package used in nodejs.

It is built off of the [Foundation URL Loading System](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/url_loading_system) (similar to [AFNetworking](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking)). NetworkUtils uses Google's [Promises](https://github.com/google/promises) library for promise support.

## Installation

NetworkUtils is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following lines to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'NetworkUtils'
```

And run ```pod install```.

## Example Usage

```swift
let networkUtils = NetworkUtils.shared

networkUtils.get("http://ip-api.com/json").then {(data) in
    print("Data found: \(data)")
}.catch {(error) in
    print("Error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
}
```
