## Overview

`NetworkUtils` is a package for implementing HTTP network requests in Swift for iOS. The goal of the project is to replicate the functionality of the [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) npm package used in nodejs.

It is built off of the [Foundation URL Loading System](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/url_loading_system) (similar to [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire)). `NetworkUtils` uses Ryu Games's [SwiftPromises](https://github.com/Ryucoin/SwiftPromises) library for promise support.

## Installation

`NetworkUtils` is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following lines to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'NetworkUtils'
```

And run ```pod install```.

## Example Usage

### HTTP Requests

Making an HTTP request with `NetworkUtils` is really simple. Use the `NetworkUtils.main` singleton object and one of the HTTP methods: `post`, `get`, `put` and `delete`.

Here is an example HTTP GET request:

``` swift
let networkUtils = NetworkUtils.main

networkUtils.get("http://ip-api.com/json").then {(data) in
  print("Data found: \(data)")
}.catch {(error) in
  print("Error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
}
```

#### Error Handling

`NetworkUtils` offers a very basic subclass of `Error` named `NetworkError`:

``` swift
public struct NetworkError: Error {
  public let msg: String
  public let code: Int
  public var localizedDescription: String {
    return "There was a Network Error with code \(code) and a message: \(msg)"
  }
}
```

Catch will reject with a `NetworkError`:

``` swift
}.catch {(error) in
  let code = error.code
  let msg = error.msg
  let localizedDescription = error.localizedDescription
}
```

### Reachability

`NetworkUtils` also offers reachability services. Access reachability with `NetworkUtils.reachability` such as in the following example:

``` swift
let reachability = NetworkUtils.reachability

switch reachability.connection {
case .wifi:
    print("Reachable via WiFi")
case .cellular:
    print("Reachable via Cellular")
case .none:
    print("Not Reachable")
}
```
